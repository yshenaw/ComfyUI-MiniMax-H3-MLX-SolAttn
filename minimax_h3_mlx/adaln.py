"""Precomputed AdaLN modulation.

~13B of MiniMax-H3's 33B parameters live in the per-block ``adaln_proj.linear`` projections
(50 blocks x ``[96768, 2688]``). Their input is the timestep embedding alone — it does not depend
on the packed sequence — so for a fixed sampler schedule every modulation tensor the whole
denoising run will ever need can be computed once, up front, and the projections then dropped.
The model card notes this explicitly: *"Because the AdaLN modulation outputs can be precomputed
and cached, these parameters do not need to be loaded for inference-only deployment."*

The saving is large and lopsided. For a 40-step schedule the cache holds

    50 blocks x 6 tensors x (40 timesteps x 3 modalities) x 5376  =  193M values

which is ~387 MB in bfloat16, against ~26 GB for the bfloat16 projections it replaces — a ~67x
reduction, and the resident DiT drops from 33B to ~20B parameters.

Precision note: the cache is built from the float32 timestep embedding through the *unquantized*
projections. Every block reads the same ``temb``, so an error introduced here biases every block's
modulation identically at every sampling step and accumulates coherently along the denoising
trajectory. Building the table before quantization keeps that path exact.
